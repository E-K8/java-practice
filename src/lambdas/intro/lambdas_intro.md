Lambda expressions in Java were introduced in Java 8 as part of the effort to make Java more functional and convenient. They provide a concise way to represent instances of single-method interfaces, which are often used as inline expressions for methods that accept functional interfaces as parameters. In simpler terms, lambda expressions are a shorthand notation for creating anonymous classes.

Here is the basic syntax of a lambda expression:

`(argument-list) -> { body-of-lambda }`

`argument-list`: Parameters required by the body of the lambda. If the lambda doesn't take any parameters, this should be an empty pair of parentheses ().
`->`: The arrow token, which separates the arguments from the body.
`body-of-lambda`: The code that will be executed when the lambda is called. It can be either a single expression or a block of statements.

### Examples

A lambda expression that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum:
`(int a, int b) -> { return a + b; }`

Simplified, since the return type and parameter types can be inferred:
`(a, b) -> a + b`

A lambda expression with no parameters:
`() -> System.out.println("Hello, World!")`

A lambda expression that takes a single parameter:
`s -> System.out.println(s)`

### Usage with Functional Interfaces

Lambda expressions are often used in conjunction with functional interfaces. A functional interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method (excluding the methods from `Object` class). Java 8 introduced several functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package, such as `Consumer<T>`, `Supplier<T>`, `Function<T`, `R>`, and `Predicate<T>`.

For example, the `Predicate<T>` interface has a method `boolean test(T t)` that takes a single argument and returns a boolean. You can use a lambda expression to create an instance of this interface:

    Predicate<Integer> isEven = n -> n % 2 == 0;
    
    System.out.println(isEven.test(4));  // Output will be true
    System.out.println(isEven.test(3));  // Output will be false

### Benefits
**Conciseness**: Lambdas can be more succinct than equivalent anonymous classes.
**Functional Programming**: Lambdas move Java closer to functional programming paradigms, allowing for more expressive code.
**Ease of Use**: Lambdas can make the code easier to read and maintain.

### Limitations
**Single Method Interfaces Only**: They can only be used to represent instances of interfaces with a single abstract method.

**Limited Scope**: They can't have instance variables or state. They can only access final or "effectively final" variables from the surrounding scope.

**Learning Curve**: For programmers new to functional programming concepts, lambda expressions may take some time to get used to.

Lambda expressions in Java are a powerful feature that make the language more expressive, enabling you to write more concise and maintainable code.
