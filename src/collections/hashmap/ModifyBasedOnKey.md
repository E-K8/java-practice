`HashMap` is one of the widely-used implementations of the Map interface in Java. The methods _put, putAll, putIfAbsent, computeIfAbsent, computeIfPresent, compute_ are used to insert, modify, or compute values based on keys in the map. Let's delve into each of them:

**put(K key, V value):**

Inserts the specified value with the specified key into the map.
If the map previously contained a value for the key, the old value is replaced.
Returns the previous value associated with the key, or null if there was no such mapping.

    HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    map.put("one", 1);  // Adds "one" -> 1 to the map

**putAll(Map<? extends K, ? extends V> m):**

Copies all mappings from the specified map to the current map.
If the current map already contains a key that exists in the given map, the old value is replaced.

    HashMap<String, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put("two", 2);
    anotherMap.put("three", 3);
    map.putAll(anotherMap);  // Adds "two" -> 2 and "three" -> 3 to the map

**putIfAbsent(K key, V value):**

Inserts the specified value with the specified key into the map only if it is not already associated with a value (or if the associated value is null).
Returns the current (existing or provided) value associated with the key.

`map.putIfAbsent("four", 4);  // Adds "four" -> 4 if "four" is not already in the map`

**computeIfAbsent(K key, Function<? super K, ? extends V> mappingFunction):**

If the key is not already associated with a value (or is associated with null), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping function and enters it into this map unless `null`.
Returns the current (existing or computed) value associated with the key.

    map.computeIfAbsent("five", k -> 5);  // If "five" is not in the map, adds "five" -> 5

**computeIfPresent(K key, BiFunction<? super K, ? super V, ? extends V> remappingFunction):**

If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value.
If the function returns `null`, the mapping is removed. If the function throws an exception, the current mapping is left unchanged.

    map.computeIfPresent("one", (k, v) -> v * 10);  // If "one" is in the map, its value is multiplied by 10

**compute(K key, BiFunction<? super K, ? super V, ? extends V> remappingFunction):**

Attempts to compute a new mapping for the given key and its current mapped value (or `null` if there is no current mapping).
If the function returns `null`, the mapping is removed (or remains absent if initially absent). If the function itself throws an exception, the exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

    map.compute("six", (k, v) -> (v == null) ? 6 : v * 6);  // If "six" is not in the map, adds "six" -> 6. If "six" is in the map, its value is multiplied by 6.

These methods are very useful for controlling the behavior of data insertion and modification in the map, especially in scenarios where atomic computations or conditional updates are required.
