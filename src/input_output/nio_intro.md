**Java NIO (New Input/Output)** is a collection of Java programming language APIs that offer a more flexible and scalable approach to I/O operations compared to the standard I/O APIs (Java IO). Introduced in Java 1.4, Java NIO provides a different way of working with I/O than the traditional I/O APIs. Key features and components of Java NIO include:

**Buffers**: In NIO, data is read and written through buffers. A buffer is a linear, finite sequence of elements of a specific primitive type. Buffers are used as the primary data structure for data exchange.

**Channels**: Channels represent connections to entities capable of performing I/O operations, such as files and sockets. Unlike streams in Java IO, channels support both reading and writing on the same object, and they can be used for non-blocking I/O operations.

**Selectors**: Selectors are used for multiplexed, non-blocking I/O operations. A single thread can manage multiple channels using selectors, thus making it possible to handle many connections without multi-threading.

**Non-blocking I/O**: Java NIO supports non-blocking I/O, where I/O operations do not block the executing thread. This is crucial for scalable network applications, as it allows a single thread to manage multiple connections.

**File I/O and File System**: NIO provides classes and interfaces for file I/O operations, including the manipulation of file attributes and file system operations, which are more efficient than those in the traditional Java IO.

**Character Set Encoders and Decoders**: NIO includes a set of character encoders and decoders for translating between bytes and Unicode characters.

**Memory-Mapped Files**: Java NIO allows files to be mapped directly into memory, facilitating faster I/O operations, especially for large files.

**Scattering and Gathering**: These are advanced I/O concepts where data from multiple buffers can be read into a single channel (gathering) or data from one channel can be read into multiple buffers (scattering).

Overall, Java NIO provides a more scalable and flexible framework for I/O operations, especially useful for high-performance networking and file handling applications.
