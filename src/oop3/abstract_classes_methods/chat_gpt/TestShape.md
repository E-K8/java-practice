Abstract classes and methods are fundamental concepts in Java that deal with the idea of abstraction. Let's dive in.

Abstract Classes
Definition: An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated. That means you cannot create an object of an abstract class. Its primary purpose is to be extended (inherited) by other classes.
Usage: An abstract class can have both abstract (methods without a body) and non-abstract methods. It can also have fields, constructors, and nested classes.
Abstract Methods
Definition: An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation. It does not have a body and ends with a semicolon.
Usage: If a class contains one or more abstract methods, then the class must be declared as abstract. The responsibility to provide the implementation of the abstract method falls on the first concrete (non-abstract) class that inherits from this abstract class.
Example:
Let's consider a simple example of a shape. We can't define a generic "shape" in real life, but we know shapes have an area. So, we can define an abstract class Shape with an abstract method area().

Points to Remember:
You cannot create an object of an abstract class.
An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
An abstract method cannot be private, as it is meant to be overridden in a subclass.
An abstract class can have constructors, and they can be used in the constructor of its subclass.
If a subclass does not provide an implementation for all of the abstract methods in its parent abstract class, then the subclass itself must also be declared abstract.
The concept of abstract classes and methods primarily helps to achieve abstraction, one of the four major principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). By forcing classes to provide implementations for abstract methods, you can ensure that certain behaviors are consistent across a set of related classes.
